This double ikat saree from Patan, Gujarat, requires a master weaver and his family to spend 6-8 months on a single piece. Both warp and weft threads are individually resist-dyed according to a precise mathematical design before weaving begins. When the threads intersect on the loom, the pattern emerges with perfect alignment — a feat of engineering and art combined. The bhat (design) on this piece features the classic nari-kunj motif — elephants amidst floral vines within a nine-element geometric grid. The silk is sourced from Karnataka mulberry farms and the natural dyes use indigo, madder root, turmeric, and pomegranate rind. Only a handful of families in Patan still practice this 900-year-old craft. This saree comes with a detailed provenance document and care instructions for preservation.',

The body features delicate floral creepers, while the pallu is dominated by the spectacular Tree of Life — its branches filled with peacocks, parrots, deer, and celestial flowers. The border narrates stories from the Panchatantra. The dyes are all natural: black from jaggery and iron filings, red from madder root, blue from indigo, yellow from pomegranate rind, green from myrobalan. The painting alone takes 15-20 days per saree. Every piece is unique — no two are exactly alike.',

The saree weighs just 250 grams, folds into a handbag, and emerges wrinkle-free. The gold zari stripes on the pallu catch light subtly rather than shouting for attention.

The body is a deep, rich purple — the color of royalty in Bengal — with delicate floral motifs scattered across. The border carries continuation of the narrative with small animal and nature motifs.

The pallu is a dense garden of chikankari in multiple stitch styles: bakhiya (shadow work), phanda (knot stitch), keel kangan (buttonhole), and murri (rice-grain stitch).

      "Fabric with a conscience. This saree is made from hand-spun khadi cotton — the fabric that symbolized India's freedom movement under Gandhi's vision of swadeshi. The cotton was grown organically in Vidarbha, hand-spun on a charkha (spinning wheel) by women in a rural cooperative, and hand-woven on a pit loom — zero electricity, zero carbon footprint. The natural indigo dye is fermented in traditional vats using the age-old reduction method. The result is a saree that breathes beautifully, softens with every wash, and carries a lineage of sustainability and self-reliance. No two pieces are exactly identical — the slight variations in slub and color are signatures of the handmade process, not defects. Wear it and feel the connection to India's greatest textile tradition.",

      'The saree that floats. Kota Doria is woven in Kaithoon, Rajasthan, using a technique passed down through generations that creates a distinctive square check pattern called "khat." The secret lies in the sizing — the yarn is treated with a mixture of onion juice and rice paste before weaving, giving it extraordinary strength despite being incredibly fine. The mint green body is translucent and feather-light (280 grams), with a subtle khat pattern catching light. The pallu features gold zari stripes against the sheer background. This is the perfect summer occasion saree — cool, elegant, and effortlessly stylish. Pairs wonderfully with silver or kundan jewelry. The saree that every woman in Rajasthan has in her wardrobe — now available to you.',

This saree pairs that raw silk beauty with hand-embroidered Kantha work from Bengal — rows of running stitch in vibrant multicolored threads creating floral and geometric patterns across the pallu. The contrast between the rustic, textured silk and the colorful, rhythmic embroidery is stunning. Each Kantha stitch is a meditation — the women who do this work sit in groups, stitching and singing.

The embroidery covers the entire surface with narrative and floral motifs in threads sourced from old saree borders — a true zero-waste creation. The artisans are women from the SHE (Self-Help Enterprise) collective in Bolpur, West Bengal, who have revived this dying craft. No two pieces are similar — each is a unique work of art.

      "My mother, Meera, spent forty years running a small saree shop near Assi Ghat. Women came from three districts to buy from her — not because she had the most stock, but because she never lied about the weave. When she retired in 2019, the weavers she'd worked with for decades were losing ground to machine-made copies. Shagya launched in 2020 with twelve sarees and a WhatsApp group of 200 women. Today we work with 50+ artisan families across eight states. Every saree on this site is photographed unedited, with the weaver's name attached. Our SHEROES initiative gives women weavers their own storefront, pays them 85% of the sale price. Currently 23 women run independent storefronts through SHEROES. We're working toward 100 by 2027. A Banarasi saree takes 15 to 45 days to weave. A power loom knocks out a copy in four hours. When you buy handloom, you're telling their children that the loom is still worth sitting at.",

The Banarasi saree is not merely fabric; it is woven history. The Mughal seed: Persian motifs — the shikargah hunting scene, the bel creeping vine, the jaal lattice — melded with indigenous Indian sensibilities. Kadhwa versus Phekwa: In Kadhwa, every motif is woven independently with zero floating threads on the reverse. Phekwa uses a running weft — faster, cheaper. A Kadhwa Banarasi takes three to six months. True zari is pure silk twisted with silver wire electroplated in 24-karat gold. Shagya works directly with master weaver families in Varanasi — every Banarasi in our collection is Kadhwa-woven, using only certified pure zari.',

The colour lexicon: red symbolises shakti and fertility, maroon and fuchsia remain most popular, gold-on-cream conveys regal restraint, midnight blue with silver zari is unexpectedly sophisticated. Budget with intelligence: a genuine handloom bridal saree starts around Rs 25,000. Invest in the zari, weave density, and pallu design.

Khadi, the original slow fashion: hand-spun and hand-woven, using roughly three litres of water per metre versus industrial cotton's ten thousand litres. Behind every handloom saree stands an ecosystem of farmer, dyer, weaver, and family. Artisan cooperatives like Khamir in Kutch and Malkha in Andhra Pradesh prove community ownership works.

Never store a silk saree in a plastic bag — plastic traps moisture and can react with silk proteins causing permanent yellowing. The correct method: fold along natural creases, wrap in clean muslin cloth, store flat in a wooden box. Every six months, refold along different lines to prevent crease stress. Do not wash silk at home — dry-cleaning is non-negotiable. Store in cool-dark-dry conditions (18-22 C, below 55% humidity). Place silica gel sachets among your saree boxes.
